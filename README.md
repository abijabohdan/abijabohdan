# Hi there, I'm AbijaðŸ‘‹

## About me:

I'm a passionate and driven Data Analyst with a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems at University of Nasional, I have developed a deep understanding of how to leverage data to derive meaningful insights and support business decision-making.

Throughout my academic and internship experiences, I've honed my skills in Python, SQL, Spreadsheets tools, Tableau, and Looker Studio. I've utilized these tools to analyze complex datasets, create predictive models, and visualize data effectively. My projects range from analyzing customer behavior to developing dashboards that communicate insights clearly and compellingly.

I'm particularly interested in roles that allow me to apply my analytical skills to solve real-world problems and contribute to data-driven strategies. Whether it's through exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, or creating insightful dashboards, I am dedicated to delivering results that drive business growth.

I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to connect with me here on LinkedIn or reach out to me directly at @abijabhdn. I look forward to discussing how we can work together to achieve great things.
